# SitRed

**SitRed** is a simple, yet powerful, server that fetches a
website's sitemap, parses it to extract the URLs, and then redirects
incoming HTTP requests to a random URL from the list.

The server is written in Go and was designed for sitemaps generated by
the [Yoast SEO WordPress
plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), but as long as
you don't feed it a sitemap index, you should be able to use with it
other kinds of sitemaps. Additionally, it should work efficiently even
with large sitemaps.

## Usage
